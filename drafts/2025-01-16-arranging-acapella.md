# Getting Started

## Your Work Environment

One of the first things you will have to decide is how you want to create your arrangment. This will all depend on the tools you have available, your background knowledge, and how you yourself work best. Aside from scoring an entire chart with pencil and paper (which has a charm to it, I suppose), your best options are to work in a music notation software, like Musescore, or to work in a Digital Audio Workstation. I have arranged charts in both fashions, and both have their pros and cons.

### Musescore
Musescore is a free music notation software with a robust feature set and a vast online library of user-created works. This is how many musicians I have worked with chose to arrange, and it probably makes the most sense for those who are comfortable working with sheet music. It is also the most streamlined method of arranging because you can export PDFs and part tracks to your group directly from Musescore. Regardless of how you arrange, your chart which almost always end up in Musescore at the end when you need to turn your note and rhythmic information into a complete piece with lyrics, dynamics, rehersal markings, etc; so arranging in Musescore directly is the most streamlined way to work.

### Digital Audio Workstation
This is my preferred method of arranging. In a DAW, you can create a MIDI track for every voice part and input notes and rhythms in the MIDI editor.

Choosing a DAW can seem a bit daunting, but there is really no *wrong* choice. I have personally worked in Ableton Live and Avid Pro Tools. Out of the two, I would say I like the Ableton Live user interface a little bit more for arranging with MIDI, but both are great choices. Ableton Live, Avid Pro Tools, Cubase, FL Studio, MOTU Digital Performer, Reaper, Logic Pro, and even GarageBand will get the job done, among countless other DAWs.

### Other Helpful Tools
Outside from the software you choose to work in, there are a few other tools I find super useful when arranging a chart.

I love working with a **piano** of some kind when arranging. I recently got a MIDI keyboard and it has been super helpful for both figuring out parts, and inputing notes directly into my DAW. I reccommend anyone work with a piano when arranging and for those working in a DAW, I would reccommend a keyboard capable of MIDI. If you have a keyboard already, there is a good chance it already has MIDI capabilities; look for any kind of USB port somewhere on the keyboard or read about your specific keyboard model online.
If you are super comfortable on the guitar, I can imagine it would be helpful in a similar manner to a piano (and you might even get some neat chord voicings because of the way chords are stacked on a guitar), just make sure you know the notes of the fret board.

A **smartphone** is one of the most useful tools to have when arranging. A piano app is super nice to have in a pinch, and a metronome app is good for choosing a tempo for your piece. I also love having a tuning app handy when arranging. Being able to sing a part and know what notes they are is super helpful if you are someone that finds a lot of harmonies by ear. In a similar vein, a recording app (voice memos) is great to have for recording little ideas you may have while away from your computer. 

In the past year or so, I have grown to love the app **iRealPro** as a tool for both rehearsing and arranging. The app was reccommended to me by a friend who called it "the best 20 dollars he has ever spent". It is tailored towards musicians with stronger backgrounds in theory but it is very user-friendly. I now use it as a way to plot out chord changes for my own arrangements or as a pocket Real Book or Ultimate Guitar with backing tracks for learning new charts.

This will absolutely not be for everyone, but I have grown to enjoy **collaborative arranging** in recent times. I find that having people to bounce ideas off of is an invaluable tool when arranging, especially if you are working with friends who have different musical backgrounds from you. If you are arranging for a group, you should always have someone else listen to your arragement before you give it to the group to learn. Take any and all feedback you get and use it as way to further refine your work.
