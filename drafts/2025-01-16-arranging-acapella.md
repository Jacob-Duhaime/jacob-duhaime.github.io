# Background

I have been a proud member of the Rhody Rhapsodies at the University of Rhode Island since the first semester of my Freshman year. In my time, I have arranged 6 different charts that the group has performed (or will be performing this semester). Seeing as this is my final semester at the Univeristy, I thought I would share my methodology for arranging and hopefully give some guidance to those interested in arranging, or who have never arranged before.

# Getting Started

## Your Work Environment

One of the first things you will have to decide is how you want to create your arrangment. This will all depend on the tools you have available, your background knowledge, and how you yourself work best. Aside from scoring an entire chart with pencil and paper (which has a charm to it, I suppose), your best options are to work in a music notation software, like Musescore, or to work in a Digital Audio Workstation. I have arranged charts in both fashions, and both have their pros and cons.

### Musescore
Musescore is a free music notation software with a robust feature set and a vast online library of user-created works. This is how much of my group chose to arrange, and it probably makes the most sense for those who are comfortable working with sheet music. It is also the most streamlined method of arranging because you can export PDFs and part tracks to your group directly from Musescore. Regardless of how you arrange, your chart which almost always end up in Musescore at the end when you need to turn your note and rhythmic information into a complete piece with lyrics, dynamics, rehersal markings, etc; so arranging in Musescore directly is the most streamlined way to work.

### Digital Audio Workstation
This is my preferred method of arranging. In a DAW, you can create a MIDI track for every voice part and input notes and rhythms in the MIDI editor.

Choosing a DAW can seem a bit daunting, but there is really no *wrong* choice. I have personally worked in Ableton Live and Avid Pro Tools. Out of the two, I would say I like the Ableton Live user interface a little bit more for arranging with MIDI, but both are great choices. Ableton Live, Avid Pro Tools, Cubase, FL Studio, MOTU Digital Performer, Reaper, Logic Pro, and even GarageBand will get the job done, among countless other DAWs.

### Other Helpful Tools
Outside from the software you choose to work in, there are a few other tools I find super useful when arranging a chart.

I love working with a **piano** of some kind when arranging. I recently got a MIDI keyboard and it has been super helpful for both figuring out parts, and inputing notes directly into my DAW. I reccommend anyone work with a piano when arranging and for those working in a DAW, I would reccommend a keyboard capable of MIDI. If you have a keyboard already, there is a good chance it already has MIDI capabilities; look for any kind of USB port somewhere on the keyboard or read about your specific keyboard model online.
If you are super comfortable on the guitar, I can imagine it would be helpful in a similar manner to a piano (and you might even get some neat chord voicings because of the way chords are stacked on a guitar), just make sure you know the notes of the fret board.

A **smartphone** is one of the most useful tools to have when arranging. A piano app is super nice to have in a pinch, and a metronome app is good for choosing a tempo for your piece. I also love having a tuning app handy when arranging. Being able to sing a part and know what notes they are is super helpful if you are someone that finds a lot of harmonies by ear. In a similar vein, a recording app (voice memos) is great to have for recording little ideas you may have while away from your computer.

This will absolutely not be for everyone, but I have grown to enjoy **collaborative arranging** in recent times. I find that having people to bounce ideas off of is an invaluable tool when arranging, especially if you are working with friends who sing a different voice part from you. Regardless of if you end up working on the arragement with other people, you should always have someone else listen to your arragement before you give it to the group to learn. Take any and all feedback you get and use it as way to further refine your work.

## Choosing a song

If you have just stumbled accross this post, it is likely because you already have a song in mind that you want to arrange and are looking for the best way to go about that process. If that is you

### What makes a good song for acapella?

There are countless factors to consider here: How big is your group? What voice parts are you arranging for? Does your group have a beatboxer ([or multiple!](https://www.youtube.com/live/PD10INm0R7E?si=Hq1QX6Sb-mD86bV4&t=915))? What is the overall musical ability of your group? What do your performances look like? What other songs (if any) will your group be performing at your shows? All of these questions will likely sway your song choice and are important things to consider when building a setlist with your group.

There are also a handful of things that I, myself, look for in a song when I am seeking out a new piece to arrange. I like looking for song with **ample harmonic information** (many instruments/voices doing different things). This gives me a lot more to work with at a baseline and gives me a better overall vision for how I want my arragement to sound. I also find myself gravitating towards lesser-known or more indie records when choosing a song. I find when you perform a song the audience does not know, they do not have any preconceived notions of how it should sound or anything to compare your arragement to. It also lets you showcase some smaller artists you think are making cool music instead of just taking a song from the Top 40 charts that the whole audience already knows. This is all a matter of personal preference though so take with that what you will.

Regardless of the song you choose just remember: any song can be arranged to sound great, it all depends on how creative you are willing to be.
